 ### Homepage
 The homepage consists of some useful stats on your post activity. It tells you how many posts have you made, and when was the last time you made a post.
 There are three links on this page -
  - Post page: View all the posts you have ever made
  - New Post page: Create a new post
  - Search page: Search the posts you have made to delete, edit or view it.
